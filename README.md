# Peachy Packing

Peachy Packing is here to help you keep track of all your belongings when you're moving!

## What's the point?

Peachy Packing was made as a student project to address the need for a more systematic and organized way of cataloguing belongings while moving. Too often items are thrown into boxes and not able to be found when they're needed. All of your belongings are searchable which allows you to locate items quickly.

## How does it work?

Peachy Packing allows you to create both boxes and items. Items may be added to boxes or left by themselves. Comments and other details allow the user to personalize their packing experience in the best way possible. When needed, users may search for any aspect of a belonging such as a specific item to see which box it is in.
