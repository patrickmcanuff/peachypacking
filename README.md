## Peachy Packing

Peachy Packing is here to help you keep track of all your belongings while you're moving. All too often, items are thrown into boxes and are unable to be found when they're needed. Peachy Packing solves this problem by allowing you to catalogue your belongings as necessary and scan boxes for their contents. It was designed with mobile in mind and works great on your phone.

You can start by adding items or boxes. Items may be assigned to a box, or left as an unassigned item. Both items and boxes have a comment section. The search bar looks for names, comments, and box sizes. A cool feature is the ability to print a QR code to tape onto a box. This allows you to later scan the box for a quick view of its contents.

Peachy Packing was made in less than two weeks as a final project at [Le Wagon (Montr√©al)](https://www.lewagon.com). Check out our:
